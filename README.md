# Image Clasiffication Project using Custom Classifier 

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, I first develop code for a custom image classifier built with PyTorch on a Jupyter notebook, to ensure that the training implementation works. Then convert the code to a Python command line application.

This app will train a deep learning model on a dataset of images then use the trained model to classify images.
